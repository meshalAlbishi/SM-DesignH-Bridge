# SM-DesignH-Bridge

## What is the Task?
Design and programming of a two-motor circuit using H-Bridge 

## The Circuit Parts

Format of Parts -> name - (QTY)

1. Arduino Uno R3 (1).
2. H-bridge Motor Driver L293D, it's an alternative to L298n because it's not available at tinkercad (1).
3. DC Motor (2).
4. 9V Battery (1).
5. breadboard (1).

## Connecting Parts

### L293D To the Arduino
- input 1 connected to pin 11.
- input 2 connected to pin 10. 
- input 3 connected to pin 9.
- input 4 connected to pin 8.
- enable 1,2,3, and 4 connected to the + power.

### L293D To the Motor
  #### Motor 1
  - Output 3 connected to the Terminal 2
  - Output 4 connected to the Terminal 1

  #### Motor 2
  - Output 1 connected to the Terminal 1
  - Output 2 connected to the Terminal 2
